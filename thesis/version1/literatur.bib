In this paper we present our first steps towards a new system
to compile functional logic programs of the source language Curry
into purely functional Haskell programs.
Our implementation is based on the idea to represent
non-deterministic results as values of the data types corresponding
to the results.
This enables the application of various search strategies
to extract values from the search space.
We show by several benchmarks that our implementation
can compete with or outperform other existing implementations of Curry.

abstract = {
KiCS2 is a new system
to compile functional logic programs of the source language Curry
into purely functional Haskell programs.
The implementation is based on the idea to represent
the search space as a data structure and logic variables
as operations that generate their values.
This has the advantage that one can apply various,
and in particular, complete search strategies to compute solutions.
However, the generation of all values for logic variables
might be inefficient for applications that
exploit constraints on partially known values.
To overcome this drawback, we propose new techniques
to implement equational constraints in this framework.
In particular, we show how unification modulo function evaluation
and functional patterns can be added without sacrificing
the efficiency of the kernel implementation.
